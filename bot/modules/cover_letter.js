CANDIDATE: ${fullName} — ${yearsText} experience${levelNote}${availNote}
ROLE: ${jobTitle}
COMPANY: ${company || 'this company'}

JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jdExcerpt}

CANDIDATE CV:

─────────────────────────────────────────────
SILENT PRE-WORK (do not output):
1. What are the 2–3 most important requirements in the JD?
2. Which specific experience or achievement from the CV best proves each one?
3. What does the JD reveal about this company or role that makes it specific — a challenge they mention, a team they describe, a tool they emphasise?

─────────────────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT — 4 paragraphs, no headings, no labels, no sign-off, no "Dear Hiring Manager":

PARAGRAPH 1 — HOOK (2 sentences):
Sentence 1: name the role and company in a confident, specific opening — NOT "I am writing to apply". Lead with the candidate's most relevant strength or achievement connected to the role's #1 requirement.
Sentence 2: say one concrete thing about why this specific role or company — pulled from what the JD actually says (a challenge, a mission, a technology) — not generic enthusiasm.

PARAGRAPH 2 — MATCH (3 sentences):
Take the top 3 requirements from the JD. For each, write one sentence that maps it directly to a specific skill or experience from the CV. Be explicit: "[JD requirement] — [candidate proof point from CV]". No vague claims.

PARAGRAPH 3 — EVIDENCE (2 sentences):
State one concrete, quantified achievement from the CV. Explain in one sentence exactly why it proves the candidate can do this job.

PARAGRAPH 4 — CLOSE (1 sentence only):
Genuine, specific enthusiasm for this role. End with a clear ask for the interview.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
HARD RULES:
- 230 words maximum total
- Every sentence must be specific to THIS job — cut anything that could appear in any other cover letter
- BANNED openers: "I am writing to", "I would like to apply", "I am interested in", "With X years", "As a", "I am excited to", "I am passionate"
- BANNED words: "passionate", "team player", "results-driven", "hard-working", "go-getter", "leveraging", "spearheading", "seamlessly", "proactive", "dynamic", "fast learner", "hit the ground running", "self-motivated"
- Do NOT invent experience not in the CV
- Do NOT mention salary
- Return ONLY the 4 paragraph body — nothing else`;
